Controlled and uncontrolled components are concepts in React related to how components manage and respond to 
user input.

    Controlled Components:
        In controlled components, form data is handled by React and managed through its state.
        The value of the form element (such as an input or textarea) is controlled by React's state and is passed
         as a prop to the component.
        When the user interacts with the form element, React calls the onChange event handler to update the state,
         and the component re-renders with the updated value.
        Controlled components are useful when you need to enforce input constraints or perform validation on user
         input before updating the state.
