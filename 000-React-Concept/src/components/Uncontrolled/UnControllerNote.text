Uncontrolled Components:

    In uncontrolled components, form data is handled by the DOM itself, rather than by React's state.
    The value of the form element is not controlled by React's state. Instead, it is determined by the DOM and 
    can be accessed via references.
    Uncontrolled components are useful when you want to integrate with non-React code or libraries, or when you 
    want to rely on browser behavior for form handling.
