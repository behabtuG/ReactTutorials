Creating and nesting components

 React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic 
 and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.

 React components are JavaScript functions that return markup:

Conditional rendering 

 In React, there is no special syntax for writing conditions. Instead, youâ€™ll use the same techniques as you use 
  when writing regular JavaScript code. For example, you can use an if statement to conditionally include JSX:
  If you prefer more compact code, you can use the conditional ? operator. Unlike if, it works inside JSX:

  //Using Hooks 
  Functions starting with use are called Hooks. useState is a built-in Hook provided by React. You can find other 
  built-in Hooks in the API reference. You can also write your own Hooks by combining the existing ones.

Hooks are more restrictive than other functions. You can only call Hooks at the top of your components (or other
 Hooks). If you want to use useState in a condition or a loop, extract a new component and put it there.
