useState: This hook is used to manage state within functional components. 
It allows you to add state variables to functional components and handle updates to those variables. 
When you call useState, it returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function 
to update that value. useState triggers re-renders when the state is updated.

In summary, useState is used for managing state that triggers re-renders, while useRef is used for accessing 
and manipulating DOM elements directly or for persisting values across renders without causing re-renders.

Allows functional components to manage state. It returns a stateful value and a function to update it.
