/* This code snippet is creating an array `arr` with elements `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`. Then it is
accessing the element at index `2` of the array using `arr[2]` and printing it to the console. In
this case, the element at index `2` is `30`, so the output will be `30`. */
let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
console.log(arr[2]); // Output: 30
