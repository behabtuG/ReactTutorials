<!-- Handling form submission involves capturing user input from HTML form elements, processing that data, and 
    performing some action based on the input, such as sending it to a server or updating the DOM.

Here's a basic example demonstrating how to handle form submission using JavaScript: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Form Submission Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Form Submission</h1>
    <form id="myForm">
      <label for="name">Name:</label>
      <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required /><br /><br />

      <label for="email">Email:</label>
      <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required /><br /><br />

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>

    <script>
      // Handle form submission
      document
        .getElementById("myForm")
        .addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
          event.preventDefault(); // Prevent the default form submission behavior

          // Get form data
          const formData = new FormData(event.target);
          const formDataObject = {};
          formData.forEach((value, key) => {
            formDataObject[key] = value;
          });

          // Process form data (for example, log it to the console)
          console.log("Form data:", formDataObject);

          // Here you can perform additional actions, such as sending the form data to a server via fetch

          // Clear form fields
          event.target.reset();
        });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- In this example:

    We have an HTML form with input fields for name and email, and a submit button.
    We use JavaScript to attach an event listener to the form's submit event.
    When the form is submitted, the event listener callback function is executed.
    We call event.preventDefault() to prevent the default form submission behavior, which would cause the page to 
    reload.
    We use FormData to collect the form data. We then convert the FormData object into a JavaScript object.
    We process the form data, for example, by logging it to the console. You can perform additional actions here, such
     as sending the data to a server via fetch.
    Finally, we reset the form fields using event.target.reset().

This example demonstrates how to handle form submission in the browser using JavaScript. You can customize it further
 based on your specific requirements, such as adding validation, sending data to a server, or updating the DOM with 
 the submitted data. -->
